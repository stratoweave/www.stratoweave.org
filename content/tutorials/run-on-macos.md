## Introduction

SORESPO is a network automation system based on the StratoWeave platform that
support configuring an IP network with L3VPN network services and manage the
full life cycle of the network, including core network infrastructure 
configuration. As part of the SORESPO git repository, there are a number of
*test environments*, offering virtual network topologies, based on 
containerized routers, for testing, development and demoing.

This document will take you through starting the virtual network lab based on
Nokia SR Linux devices and provisioning it with the SORESPO network 
automation system. 

With the advent of router vendors shipping ARM64 images of their containerized
routers, running labs and development environments on macOS with Apple Silicon
has become really attractive. It should also work on macOS on Intel but you'll
likely need more CPU cores and memory allocated to Docker than described here.

## Preparing the Environment

* Install the following prerequisites:
  * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or
    [Colima](@/tutorials/colima.md) if you prefer an open-source alternative)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac) and *coreutils* , both of which
    you can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
  ```shell
  brew install git coreutils
  ```
* After the installation has completed, start your container runtime.
    * For *Docker Desktop*, open *Settings* and in the *Resources* section make
        sure you've allocated at least 4 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM to Docker.
    * Or, start your Colima VM with the appropriate resources:
      ```shell
      colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8
      ```

## Starting the SORESPO Network

Clone the project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/stratoweave/sorespo.git
```

Go into the `sorespo/test/quicklab-srl` directory and start the tutorial:
```shell
cd sorespo/test/quicklab-srl
make tutorial
...
... # Containerlab starts the SR Linux lab, this may take a few minutes ...
...
StratoWeave/sorespo running..
```

This will start the entire SR Linux network lab and run the SORESPO system in
the foreground in this shell window. It will show log output from SORESPO as
it is working. **Open a second shell** to continue with the tutorial.

*Note*: The lab can be shut down with `make stop`

At this point, your containerized routers are running with only management
access configured, allowing SORESPO to connect and push configuration. The
SORESPO system is also running but has no network or service intent
configuration loaded.

## Loading intent configuration into SORESPO

`tutorial-netinfra.xml` describes the intent for the network infrastructure,
including the list of core routers and backbone links between them. In a new
shell, navigate to the `sorespo/test/quicklab-srl`
directory and load the configuration intent:
```shell
cd sorespo/test/quicklab-srl
make send-config-wait FILE="tutorial-netinfra.xml" 
```

`tutorial-l3vpn-svc.xml`  describes the intent for the customer's L3VPN service.
Load the configuration intent to create a customer VPN across all three
core routers, and the access links to the customer's sites:
```shell
make send-config-wait FILE="tutorial-l3vpn-svc.xml" 
```

The resulting network lab has three core SR Linux routers, each with an attached
customer edge device running FRRouting. This diagram shows the topology:

```


To test the above topology, you can log directly into a core router and run a
few commands.

Log in to the `ams-core-1` router:
```
make cli-ams-core-1
```

On the SR Linux CLI issue the following commands:
```
/ show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor
ping network-instance default 10.0.0.2
```

These commands show that the loopback addresses are reachable and iBGP has been
established between the 3 core routers. Use *Ctrl+C* to stop the `ping` command
and `quit` to log out of the router.

*Note*: The [SR Linux Configuration Basics](https://documentation.nokia.com/srlinux/24-3/title/basics.html)
are a great introduction to the Nokia SR Linux CLI.

## Service Automation Layering In SORESPO

SORESPO implements highly abstracted device and service configuration through
layers of automation. While SORESPO is implemented using four discrete layers,
StratoWeave does not place any limitations on the number of layers that can be
implemented - as few or many as necessary can be used.

```
                        +-------------------------------+
+-----------------------| RESTCONF Northbound Interface |-----------------------+
|                       +-------------------------------+                       |
|               +-----------------------------------------------+               |

|               +-----------------------------------------------+               |
|               +-----------------------------------------------+               |
|               |                Device - Layer 3               |               |
|               +-----------------------------------------------+               |
|                       +-------------------------------+                       |
+-----------------------|  NETCONF Southbound Interface |-----------------------+
                        +-------------------------------+
```


The SORESPO system implements a RESTCONF northbound interface, which is
model-driven by StratoWeave based on the top-level CFS YANG model of the SORESPO
system.

For many common queries and tasks, `make` targets are implemented to send the
relevant RESTCONF requests. 


### Configuration at Layer 0 - Customer Facing Service (CFS)

The Customer Facing Service (top-level) YANG model defines SORESPO's northbound
interface for users and/or BSS/OSS platforms. The YANG modules for `layer0` are
located in `sorespo/spec/yang/cfs`.

Retrieve the top-level (CFS) configuration (`layer0`) from SORESPO:

```shell
make get-config0
```

*Note*: XML is used for all of the examples throughout this tutorial, but if
you prefer JSON format, use:
```shell
make get-config-json0
```

The resulting output has two top-level containers, `<netinfra>` (the first
 configuration file you loaded), which describes the configuration of the
network devices and topology, and `<l3vpn-svc>` (the second configuration file
you loaded) which is an implementation of `ietf-l3vpn-svc.yang` defined
in [RFC8299](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8299). The L3VPN Service
Model is used to define the VPNs, customer attachment points and other
parameters necessary for provisioning customer L3VPN services.

```xml
<netinfra xmlns="http://example.com/netinfra">
...
</netinfra>
<l3vpn-svc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-svc">
...
</l3vpn-svc>
```


#### Core Network Topology Configuration `<netinfra>`

`<netinfra>` holds the router and backbone link configuration. At `layer0`,
this is highly abstracted with only the essential parameters being exposed.
The other automation layers implement the logic necessary to create the device
level configuration (described by vendor supplied YANG modules).

```xml
<netinfra xmlns="http://example.com/netinfra">
  <router>
    <name>AMS-CORE-1</name>
    <id>1</id>
    <role>edge</role>
    <asn>65001</asn>
  </router>
  ...
  <backbone-link>
    <left-router>AMS-CORE-1</left-router>
    <left-interface>ethernet1-1</left-interface>
    <right-router>FRA-CORE-1</right-router>
    <right-interface>ethernet1-1</right-interface>
  </backbone-link>
  ...
</netinfra>  
```

The `<router>` container defines the router's name and its role in the network
topology (`core` / `edge`).

The `<backbone-link>` container defines the necessary endpoint paramaters to
configure a link between two routers.



#### L3VPN Service Configuration `<ietf-l3vpn-svc>`

The configuration for the L3VPN services itself contains two top-level
containers as well. These are defined in the IETF's L3VPN Service YANG model.
The first, `<vpn-services>`, defines the customer's VPN and the second,
`<sites>`, is a list of connection points which configure the edge router's
links to customer's sites, as follows:

```xml
<l3vpn-svc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-svc">
  <vpn-services>
    <vpn-service>
      <vpn-id>acme-65501</vpn-id>
      <customer-name>CUSTOMER-1</customer-name>
    </vpn-service>
  </vpn-services>
  <sites>
    <site>
      <site-id>SITE-1</site-id>
      <locations>
        <location>
          <location-id>MAIN</location-id>
        </location>
      </locations>
      <management>
        <type>customer-managed</type>
      </management>
      <site-network-accesses>
        <site-network-access>
          <site-network-access-id>SNA-1-1</site-network-access-id>
          <location-reference>MAIN</location-reference>
          <bearer>
            <bearer-reference>AMS-CORE-1,ethernet1-3.100</bearer-reference>
          </bearer>
          <ip-connection>
            <ipv4>
              <address-allocation-type>static-address</address-allocation-type>
              <addresses>
                <provider-address>10.201.1.1</provider-address>
                <customer-address>10.201.1.2</customer-address>
                <prefix-length>30</prefix-length>
              </addresses>
            </ipv4>
          </ip-connection>
          <service>
            <svc-input-bandwidth>1000000000</svc-input-bandwidth>
            <svc-output-bandwidth>1000000000</svc-output-bandwidth>
            <svc-mtu>9000</svc-mtu>
          </service>
          <routing-protocols>
            <routing-protocol>
              <type>bgp</type>
              <bgp>
                <autonomous-system>65501</autonomous-system>
                <address-family>ipv4</address-family>
              </bgp>
            </routing-protocol>
          </routing-protocols>
          <vpn-attachment>
            <vpn-id>acme-65501</vpn-id>
          </vpn-attachment>
        </site-network-access>
      </site-network-accesses>
    </site>
</l3vpn-svc>
```


### Configuration at Layer 1 - Intermediate 

In SORESPO, the next layer down is the *Intermediate* layer. At this layer,
the implemented YANG modules are less abstracted than at `layer0`. Additional
parameters are calculated by the service automation. The YANG modules for `layer1` are
located in `sorespo/spec/yang/inter`.

The `layer1` configuration can be retrieved with the following command:

```shell
make get-config1
```

This excerpt from the output shows the intermediate layer configuration for the
`AMS-CORE-1` router. The IPv4 and IPv6 addressing for the loopback interface
for the device are added. These have been calculated according to a pre-defined
set of addressing rules.

Additionally, there is configuration for the customer's `acme-65501` VPN which
has been defined in the layer0 `ietf-l3vpn-svc` configuration.

```xml
<netinfra xmlns="http://example.com/netinfra-inter">
  <router>
    <name>AMS-CORE-1</name>
    <id>1</id>
    <role>edge</role>
    <base-config>
      <asn>65001</asn>
      <ipv4-address>10.0.0.1</ipv4-address>
      <ipv6-address>2001:db8:0:0::1</ipv6-address>
    </base-config>
    <l3vpn-vrf>
      <vpn-id>acme-65501</vpn-id>
      <ebgp-customer-address>10.201.1.2</ebgp-customer-address>
    </l3vpn-vrf>
  </router>
```

At the Intermediate layer, we also introduce a new container for configuring
iBGP between the core routers. As the configuration for this is entirely
deterministic, we don't need to expose it at `layer0`. All of the iBGP
configuration is created through SORESPO's automation, derived from the CFS
intent. The logic is simple, all core routers will form an iBGP full-mesh.

*Note*: it would be trivial to add route-reflectors, suitable for larger networks

The Intermediate layer calculates the IPv4 addresses used for each
of the peering routers and configures authentication.

```xml
<netinfra xmlns="http://example.com/netinfra-inter">
  ...
  <ibgp-fullmesh>
    <asn>65001</asn>
    <authentication-key>ibgp-authentication-key</authentication-key>
    <router>
      <name>AMS-CORE-1</name>
      <ipv4-address>10.0.0.1</ipv4-address>
    </router>
    <router>
      <name>FRA-CORE-1</name>
      <ipv4-address>10.0.0.2</ipv4-address>
    </router>
    <router>
      <name>STO-CORE-1</name>
      <ipv4-address>10.0.0.3</ipv4-address>
    </router>
  </ibgp-fullmesh>
  ...
<netinfra>
```

At the Intermediate layer, the L3VPN service configuration is re-structured as
follows:

```xml
<l3vpns xmlns="http://example.com/l3vpn-inter">
  <l3vpn>
    <name>acme-65501</name>
    <description>Customer VPN for CUSTOMER-1</description>
    <endpoint>
      <device>AMS-CORE-1</device>
      <interface>ethernet1-3.100</interface>
      <site>SITE-1</site>
      <site-network-access>SNA-1-1</site-network-access>
      <provider-ipv4-address>10.201.1.1</provider-ipv4-address>
      <customer-ipv4-address>10.201.1.2</customer-ipv4-address>
      <ipv4-prefix-length>30</ipv4-prefix-length>
      <bgp>
        <as-number>65501</as-number>
      </bgp>
    </endpoint>
    ...
</l3vpn>
```



### Configuration at Layer 2 - Resource Facing Service (RFS)

`layer2` is the Resource Facing Service (RFS) layer. Once again, configuration
at this layer is more explicit and concrete, with more parameters being 
filled-in by the automation. The main role of the RFS layer is to provide a 
stable vendor-agnostic abstraction to the upper layers. This means that new 
device type's YANG models and versions, or other device management protocol
integrations can be added without needing to make any changes to the
Intermediate or CFS layers above. All RFS transforms are written per device,
that is, a single RFS transform only writes to a single device. This enables
RFS transforms to be re-run in order to react to changes on the device.

The YANG modules for `layer2` are located in `sorespo/spec/yang/rfs`.

At this layer, there is an instance of `<device>` container per managed device
and a corresponding `<rfs>` container defining the devices SORESPO is
managing and the RFS services that SORESPO defines.

Retrieve the configuration for `layer2`:
```shell
make get-config2
```

Which gives the following output:
```xml
<rfs>
  <name>AMS-CORE-1</name>
  <base-config>
    <name>AMS-CORE-1</name>
    <ipv4-address>10.0.0.1</ipv4-address>
    <ipv6-address>2001:db8:0:0::1</ipv6-address>
    <asn>65001</asn>
    <ibgp-authentication-key>ibgp-authentication-key</ibgp-authentication-key>
  </base-config>
  <backbone-interface>

#### Configuration at Layer 3 - The Device Layer

The vendor proprietary device YANG models are located on this layer. The YANG
modules are organized in directories by device and software version:

* For Cisco IOS-XR: `sorespo/spec/yang/CiscoIosXr_25_3_1`
* For Jupiper JUNOS: `JuniperCRPD_24_4R1_9`
* For Nokia SR-Linux: `NokiaSRLinux_25_3_2`

Retrieve the configuration for `layer2`:
```
make get-config3
```

The output is several hundred lines of XML defining the full configuration of
each of the core router devices. The XML namespaces
( `xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:`) indicate that these are the vendor models.


## Adding a new Core Router to the Topology

In order to add a new router to the network, including provisioning the
backbone links and iBGP peering, all we need to do is send in the
configuration for that router. The configuration is defined in
`test/quicklab-srl/netinfra-add-lju.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<data>
    <netinfra xmlns="http://example.com/netinfra">
       <router>
            <name>LJU-CORE-1</name>
            <id>4</id>
            <role>core</role>
            <asn>65001</asn>
       </router>
       <backbone-link>
            <left-router>FRA-CORE-1</left-router>
            <left-interface>ethernet-1/3</left-interface>
            <right-router>LJU-CORE-1</right-router>
            <right-interface>ethernet-1/1</right-interface>
        </backbone-link>
        <backbone-link>
            <left-router>STO-CORE-1</left-router>
            <left-interface>ethernet-1/3</left-interface>
            <right-router>LJU-CORE-1</right-router>
            <right-interface>ethernet-1/2</right-interface>
        </backbone-link>
    </netinfra>
</data>
```

Send this configuration to SORESPO:
```shell
make send-config-wait FILE="tutorial-add-lju.xml"
```

The topology now has four core routers.
Log in to the new router:
```shell
make cli-lju-core-1
```

Run the following command to review the BGP neighbor state:
```shell
/ show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor
```

The resulting output shows that iBGP sessions with the other 3 core routers
have been established:
```

```

The new LJU-CORE-1 router has been configured and the necessary
configuration, iBGP neighbors, on all the other routers was automatically
added as per the updated intent (4 routers) as well.

Connect a customer site to the new router:

```shell
make send-config-wait FILE="tutorial-add-cust-4.xml"
```

The resulting topology is as follows:

Test the connectivity between all of the customer's routers with this command:
```shell
make test-ping
```
*NOTE*: It may take up to a minute for the customer and provider routers to establish a BGP session and exchange routes.

Throughout this tutorial you have used the `send-config-wait` target to apply
intent configuration. This synchronous method waits for StratoWeave to apply the
configuration to the device(s) before it returns. Usually, asynchronous
operations are preferred. Try using the `send-config-async` target instead and
notice how your terminal returns as soon as the intent was accepted by SORESPO.

## What's Next
Now that you are familiar with running SORESPO and interacting with it,
continue by learning how to make [changes to the automation code](@/tutorials/develop-on-macos.md).
